# JS-dicountCalculator

## About the project  

This is a discount calculator created for a freelance worker who wants to calculate his rates given 8 hour days with a discount if the project spans several months. He wants to give a discount for every full month worked and any remaining days that don't equal a full month will be billed at his regular rate. This calculator is free to use and needs no permissions for use. I created this calculator via the popular coding website [Exercism](https://exercism.org/dashboard) with no help and a lot of googling about math.

## Getting started  

You can clone this repositry to your own machine via the following commands in your terminal:  

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ikyle53/JS-dicountCalculator.git  
$ cd JS-discountCalculator
```


### Tasks for this project  

I'd like to make this universal so that anyone can enter inputs and recieve accurate results based on their income/discount they want to provide.

- [x] Calculate the income for an 8 hour day.
- [x] Calculate the days that are discounted and the days that are not discounted.
- [x] Subtract the discounted amount from the non-discounted amount over the specified number of days.
- [x] Add the total non-discounted amount to the total amount with the discount already applied.
